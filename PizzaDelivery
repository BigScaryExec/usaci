Problem we were given, to solve for $10, is how to optimize pizza delivery for a large US chain.
Factors include:
goal of 30 minute delivery most of the time, and max of 45 minutes 100% of the time
All results are probabilistic (e.g., making an order, which likely includes pizza, takes 18 minutes on average, with a wide distribution).
